NAME
    HTML::HTML5::Sanity - make HTML5 DOM trees less insane.

VERISON
    0.03

SYNOPSIS
      use HTML::HTML5::Parser;
      use HTML::HTML5::Sanity;
  
      my $parser    = HTML::HTML5::Parser->new;
      my $html5_dom = $parser->parse_file('http://example.com/');
      my $sane_dom  = fix_document($html5_dom);
  
      print $sane_dom->toClarkML;

DESCRIPTION
    The Document Object Model (DOM) generated by HTML::HTML5::Parser meets
    the requirements of the HTML5 spec, but will probably catch a lot of
    people by surprise.

    The main oddity is that elements and attributes which appear to be
    namespaced are not really. For example, the following element:

      <div xml:lang="fr">...</div>

    Looks like it should be parsed so that it has an attribute "lang" in the
    XML namespace. Not so. It will really be parsed as having the attribute
    "xml:lang" in the null namespace.

    "fix_document"
          $sane_dom = fix_document($html5_dom);

        Returns a modified copy of the DOM and leaving the original DOM
        unmodified.

    $HTML::HTML5::Sanity::FIX_LANG_ATTRIBUTES
          $HTML::HTML5::Sanity::FIX_LANG_ATTRIBUTES = 2;
          $sane_dom = fix_document($html5_dom);

        If set to 1 (the default), the package will detect invalid values in
        @lang and @xml:lang, and remove the attribute if it is invalid. If
        set to 2, it will also attempt to canonicalise the value (e.g.
        'EN_GB' will be converted to to 'en-GB'). If set to 0, then the
        value of language attributes is not checked.

  Deprecated Functions
    The following are deprecated and will be removed in a later version of
    HTML::HTML5::Sanity. Use XML::LibXML::Debugging instead.

    "document_to_clarkml", "element_to_clarkml", "attribute_to_clarkml",
          $string = document_to_clarkml($document);
          $string = element_to_clarkml($element);
          $string = attribute_to_clarkml($attribute);

        Returns a Clark-Notation-like string useful for debugging. Only the
        first function, which takes an XML::LibXML::Document is exported by
        default, but by choosing an export list of ":all" or ":debug" will
        export the others too.

    "document_to_hashref", "element_to_hashref", "attribute_to_hashref",
          $data = document_to_hashref($document);
          $data = element_to_hashref($element);
          $data = attribute_to_hashref($attribute);

        Returns a hashref useful for debugging. Only the first function,
        which takes an XML::LibXML::Document is exported by default, but by
        choosing an export list of ":all" or ":debug" will export the others
        too.
